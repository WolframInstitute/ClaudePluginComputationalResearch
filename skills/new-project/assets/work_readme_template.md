# Work

Execution state for {{PROJECT_NAME}} — what's being built now. Each file is one
**work item**: a Spec (what to build), Tasks (one ≈ one session), and a Progress
log. Durable knowledge lives in `Wiki/`.

An item's **status is its folder** — there is no status field:

| Folder | Meaning | Names |
|---|---|---|
| `Active/` | in progress | `<Name>.md` |
| `Backlog/` | proposed / not started (drafts live here) | `<Name>.md` |
| `Done/` | completed | `YYYY-MM-DD-<Name>.md` (completion date) |
| `Dropped/` | abandoned / superseded | `YYYY-MM-DD-<Name>.md` (drop date) |

Changing status is a `git mv`. Names are clean while an item is live and get a
date prefix when archived, so `Done/` and `Dropped/` read chronologically.

Run `/next-session` in a **fresh** session to work the next task of an active
item — clean context per task is the whole point. Use `/work` to create a new item.

## Active

The one thing the folders can't show — each in-progress item and its next task.
`Backlog/`, `Done/`, and `Dropped/` are not mirrored here; browse the folders.

| Item | Next task |
